1. This includes the name of the club, its location and various statistics about the club such as how many wins, draws and defeats an instance of it has achieved in the season, the number of goals received and scored, the number of points that a club currently has, and the number of matches played.

This includes a menu based on command line interface based input (i.e.
console and NOT graphical components) and give the user the choice of:
• Create a new football club and add it in the premier league.
• Delete (relegate) an existing club from the premier league.
• Display the various statistics for a selected club.
• Display the Premier League Table, i.e. display all the teams playing in the premier
league and some of their statistics, in descending order, according to the points
they have. Thus, the club which has the maximum number of points
displays first, the club being second in the league displays next, etc.
In the case which two clubs have the same number of points the club with the
best goal difference appears first.
• Add a played match with its score and its date, so that the statistics of the two
clubs involved and the premier league table are updated automatically.
• Saving in a file of all the information entered by the user. 
• The next time the application starts it reads all the information saved in the
previous file and continue its
operation based on that with the user being able to enter new information or
change the existing information.
This implements a graphical user interface (GUI) which is able to do the
following:
• Display the list (table) of all the teams and their statistics in descending order of
points.
• Give the user the possibility of sorting the previous table according to goals scored
(descending order).
• Give the user the possibility of sorting the previous table according to the largest
number of wins (descending order).
• Add a button which displays all the played matches sorted in ascending order of
date played (both randomly generated or manually entered using the text menu
function-ality described above). This should display all the matches played,
included matches inserted and generated in previous runs of the application
(assuming that the user saved the information entered using the text menu
functionality above).
• Add a button and a textbox which can be used to search for all matches played in
a given date. The full details of the matches should be displayed (i.e. both club
names and the score).
